# TIARF_installation

Bahoroopdarshak is an interactive art made in HTML5 Canvas and vanillajs. The artwork mimics the kaleidoscopic effect to the movement of the viewer's hand's motion, showing an eternal dance of colours and patterns. 
The artwork can be browsed in any mobile chrome browser.

The artwork was also a part of the Irregulars art fair held in Delhi along with other artists' work from all across the world for which it was adapted to work with websockets.
