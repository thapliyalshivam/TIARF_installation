Bahoroopdarshak is an interactive art made in HTML5 Canvas and WebSockets. The artwork mimics the kaleidoscopic effect to the movement of the viewer's hand's motion, showing an eternal dance of colours and patterns. The artwork was also a part of the Irregulars art fair held in Delhi along with other artists' work from all across the world.
